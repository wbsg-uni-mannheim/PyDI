    "# PyDI Data Integration Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates comprehensive data integration using PyDI. We'll work with movie datasets to showcase the data integration pipeline from entity matching to Data Fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Profiling**: Load and analyze movie datasets with provenance tracking\n",
    "2. **Identity Resolution**: \n",
    "   - Blocking strategies (Standard, Sorted Neighbourhood, Token-based, Embedding-based)\n",
    "   - Multi-attribute similarity matching with custom comparators\n",
    "   - Machine learning-based entity matching\n",
    "3. **Data Fusion**: \n",
    "   - Conflict resolution with custom fusion rules\n",
    "   - Quality assessment against test set\n",
    "   - Provenance-based conflict resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use three movie datasets:\n",
    "- **Academy Awards**: Movies with Oscar information (4,592 records)\n",
    "- **Actors**: Movies with actor details (149 records) \n",
    "- **Golden Globes**: Movies with Golden Globe awards (2,286 records)\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets contain overlapping movie information but with different attributes, data quality issues, and conflicting values - perfect for demonstrating real-world data integration challenges."
